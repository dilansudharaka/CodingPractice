#1. QuickSort recursive Algorithm
General
- inplace algorithm.
- No extra memory used.
- O(NLog(N))
-Worst Case O(n2)

Improvements.
- Using last index as the pivot may give the worst results when the array is already sorted.To avoid that
  by selecting a random index as the pivot or chosing the median of the first, middle and the last element 
  of the partition for the pivot.
- To reduce the recursion depth, recur first for the smaller half of the array and then do the other part.
- Function uses call stack to store intermeditate results. Function call stack stored other bookkeeping information
  along with the programdata as well as resuming executions.
  To avoid the use of funtion call stack we can implement PArtition function using a stack.
